What even is design?

A non-formal definition: Creating a plan that shows how the thing you want to build looks and functions before you actually build it.

You're an engineer. You get a Figma link from the resident designer on your team for a new product you're building, and you're assigned to implement it. You go back to your IDE and start turning pixels into code, emerging a few days later with a product that vaguely resembles or is spot-on what they produced, depending on engineering limitations (82% of the time it's based on how many other projects you and your teammates are currently hammering out). After getting feedback from design, product, you ship it, or go back and fix the "look and feel" and any other quirks until the feature is good enough to ship.

What does this process look like from a designer's perspective?

Umm, well...I guess they have a bunch of assets that are part of your company's design system, or, lacking that, a bunch of icons, illustrations, photos that they copy and paste them into Sketch or Figma or Adobe XD or InVision, and arrange them to look super profesh so they look nice to customers.

You know there's more to it than that. People get whole degrees in Graphic Design.

But, to you, it looks like this

What do you do first? Wireframing? That's a thing people do. That software that strips down all the intimating decisions you have to make about type, color palette, what assets to use, and just focuses on layout and interactions? Is it worth it? IMO, no. Why even wireframe?

Just start making the thing.

**A Random Walk Through Tutorial Land:**

Takeaway: Don't backpack through Tutorial Land. It's just a day hike.

What do you pack? What are the essentials? We're not glamping. We're not bringing cots, sleeping mats, a propane-powered space heater, string lights, 3-ply toilet paper. All you're getting is a tarp, a hammock, and trail mix.

Here are the essentials:

Pick the ONE tutorial that will teach you have to get started, and RTFM for everything else.

Here's a summary of the tutorials I used to learn how to use Adobe XD:

I looked at sites abouot how to install / use UI Kits, how to create background blur, and how to create Components (but that didn't help me at all during the process, it was just a workflow optimizations for designers who aren't impostering. It's good to know that it's there.

Grabbed these palettes that seemed to complement one another from Adobe Color: trusting my intiuation on this. <Link to palettes>

**Typefaces**

This took me a lot longer than I care to mention. Adobe Fonts. In the end, I just chose Avenir, which was already built in. But for the logo itself, I was embarrassed to say how long it took me.

The final three came down to:

Mari

Flyswim

Blockhead OT

Wanted to keep it loose and sketchy. Would would my ideal font look like if someone literally sketched this out?

**Choosing a name for the app.**

"Sketched Out" - cute play on words. Ultimately, I want folks to submit this frequently enough to feel like they're all skeched out because they've been producing so much work.

**Do I need a "logo" logo?**

I want to draw a little animated turtle mascot wearing a beret, because I like turtles and artists wear berets. That's it.

Look through a bunch of apps that have the look and feel you want. I chose "Happyfeed". Light, airy, unintimidating and it presents itself in a way that makes you want to use it, because it has such a low learning curve.

Is this stealing?

TBH, I don't know. You tell me. Happyfeed itself uses the concept of "stories". Does that mean it's stealing? Do I have to pick more than one source in order for it to be "inspiration" vs. stealing? How much of my taste is informed by years of interacting with apps I find visually appealing and have thus subconsciously embedded themselves in my mind when I have to draw from it to make something brand new that fits my tastes.

How do I get better at this?

Chances are that, like mine, you're not gonna be on the cutting edge of design.

Well, fellow imposters, here's how I'm doing it.

**Refactoring UI notes**

I went out and bought Refactoring UI, which I heard about on the Ladybug podcast here:

Also, I started reading Refactoring UI after writing this blog post, and I now have some justifications for why the things I thought would work actually DO work.

E.g., rounded corners and sans-serif typeface. Color choices making things seem less series.

That's what I was talking about with "is it stealing" â€” if you want to look at "Why is stealing wrong?" from the self-interested perspective

FraudoHow do you grow from here? your design

And I'm starting to listen to The <insert name of the design podcast your'e listening to here> podcast to actually stay abreast of the cutting edge.

Oh, and I've heard Debbie Millman is good, too.
